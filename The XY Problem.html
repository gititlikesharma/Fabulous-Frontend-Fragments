<h1>The XY Problem</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<h2>What is it ?</h2>
<p>The XY problem is asking about your attempted <i>solution</i> rather than your actual <i>problem</i>. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.</p>
<ul>
<li>User wants to do X.</li>
<li>User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.</li>
<li>User doesn't know how to do Y either.</li>
<li>User asks for help with Y.</li>
<li>Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.</li>
<li>After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem occurs when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable step back and explain the issue in full.</p>
<h2>What to do about it?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.</li>
<li>If someone asks for more information, do provide details.</li>
<li>If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn't be asking for help right?</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>
n00b doesn't actually want the last 3 chracters in a filename, he wants the file extensions, so why ask for the last 3 characters?
</p>
<div class='xyexample'>
<p>
&lt;n00b&gt; How can I echo the last three characters in a filename?<br />
&lt;feline&gt; If they're in a variable: echo ${foo: -3}<br />
&lt;feline&gt; Why 3 characters? What do you REALLY want?<br />
&lt;feline&gt; Do you want the extension?<br />
&lt;n00b&gt; Yes.<br />
&lt;feline&gt; There's no guarantee that every filename will have a three-letter extension,<br />
&lt;feline&gt; so blindly grabbing three characters does not solve the problem.<br />
&lt;feline&gt; echo ${foo##*.}<br />
</p>
</div>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>
If Angela had just started by explaining she wants to prevent others from detecting her OS, this could have been a much shorter and more productive discussion.
</p>
<div class='xyexample'>
<p>
Angela: 'nmap -O -A 127.0.0.1' returns some lines starting with 'OS:'. How to change it?<br />
Obama: Look in the sourcecode for nmap, find how it figures out the Linux part, then rewrite your TCP/IP stack to not operate in a way nmap can detect.<br />
Angela: Yeah, but I don't know about linux system api at all.<br />
Obama: Well, nmap's fingerprint is based on the way the TCP/IP stack works, there's no real way except to rewrite the appropriate parts of said stack.<br />
Angela: I really need to avoid these messages. Can iptables do this work?<br />
Obama: Well, don't use OS detection or version scanning<br />
Angela: I want to prevent others from knowing the type of my OS<br />
