        <header><h1 class="section-header">Background Knowledge</h1></header>
        <p>Although a background of art or drawing skill may make your illustration journey a quicker one, it is NOT required. Anyone can learn to illustrate and create art as long as they are willing to put in the immense time and effort required.</p>
        <p>Remember:<br><em>Anything worth doing takes time!</em></br>

        <header><h1 class="section-header">How to Learn</h1></header>
        <p>Everyone's approach to art will be different and your creative journey will not look the same as any other artist. Developing your skill and artistic voice is a highly personal experience.</p>
        <p>However, there are certain things that all creatives can do to aid their progress and the efficient development of their skills. Some of these practices and habits are listed below.</p>
      <ul id="skill-tips">
        <li>Consistent practice</li>
        <li>Use references</li>
        <li>Study from life</li>
        <li>Build a visual library</li>
        <li>Learn from others</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="sub-header">Consistency</h4>
        <p>Consistent daily practice is key to developing illustration skills. 
          Creating a mental library that you can draw from for your art requires frequent and consistent drawing.
          In art, your brain is a muscle as much as your hands are. You have to exercise them both rigorously.
        </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header">Use Reference</h4>
        <p>Using reference refers to analyzing the work of other illustrators and artists in order to further develop your skills.
          It does <b>not</b> refer to copying or plagarizing someone's art or artistic voice. When referencing, you should observe the reference while taking notes
          of the elements you admire. You should then put the reference away and attempting to replicate the elements you took note of in your own work.
        </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header">Study From Life</h4>
        <p>Drawing from nature, daily life, and the human form is a great way to develop foundational skills that will carry through your illustration journey and career.</p>

            <li>Finishing supplies</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Finding your own artistic style takes time and dedication. This can often be the most frustrating part of an artist's journey.
          However, often trusting your own natural instincts and artistic vision can be the most beneficial practice.
          <br>
          <br>Some more tips include:</br>
            <ul>
              <li>Referencing art from an admired illustrator</li>
              <li>Completing studies of style elements that you admire</li>
              <li>Taking notes on your own illustrations, specifically what elements you like and those you don't</li>
            </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Portfolio">
        <header><h1 class="section-header">Portfolio</h1></header>
        <p>A portfolio is essential for illustrators. It is how you will present your skill set and abilities to future
          potential employers. Your portfolio serves as a compilation of the breadth of your work. It should include what
          you deam your greatest pieces, as well as pieces that convey your range of skill and capabilites.

        <header><h1 class="section-header">Building a Business</h1></header>
        <p>After you have successfully completed a portfolio you need to share that collection of work. A great starting 
          place is through social medias such as Instagram, Twitter, and ArtStation. Consistently share your work online 
          in order to develop your online professional presence.
        <br />
        <br />
          You can also pursue professional illustration through a more traditional path. You can query illustration agencies
          and work to obtain an agent who will represent you and help bring you clients.

        <header><h1 class="section-header">Patience and Perserverance</h1></header>
        <p>The key to success as an illustrator, as with many competitive careers, is patience and perserverance. You won't 
          develop your skills or online presence overnight. Your journey will take consistency and determination. When you
          first begin to develop your business or career it may be slow-going. Use that time to continnue to hone your skills
        and further develop your portfolio.
